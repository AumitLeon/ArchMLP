# Introduction

## About

ArchMLP \(Architect Machine Learning Platform\) is a scalable machine learning platform designed with a microservices architecture. The platform was originally theorized in this [work](https://aumitleon.com/assets/projects/archMLP_report.pdf) during a senior seminar course at Middlebury College. 

This platform combines the _analytical_ and the _operational_ settings involved in developing modern machine learning models. The _analytical_ setting is concerned with developing models and attaining a high test/validation accuracy by reducing overfitting. The _operational_ setting seeks to optimize performance by making the model queryable and highly available for users.
